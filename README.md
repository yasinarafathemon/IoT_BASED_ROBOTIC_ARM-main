# IoT-Based Robotic Arm

IoT-Based Robotic Arm is a microcontroller project for remotely controlling and automating a robotic arm using IoT connectivity. The repository contains firmware written primarily in C++ and C for common microcontrollers (Arduino / ESP8266 / ESP32), example sketches, wiring guidance, and documentation to help you build, run, and extend the arm.

This README was added to give a clear overview of the project, how to set it up, and where to find and modify the code.

## Project overview

The project implements control logic for a servo-based robotic arm that can be controlled remotely over Wi‑Fi / MQTT / HTTP or run local autonomous routines. The codebase mixes C++ (control logic, network handling) and C (low-level routines / drivers). It is designed to be modular so you can replace network layers or add sensors.

## Features

- Remote control through IoT protocols (MQTT / HTTP)
- Servo control for multi-joint robotic arm
- Basic automation routines (preset positions)
- Sensor hooks for feedback (limit switches, potentiometers, IMU)
- Example sketches for common boards (Arduino UNO, ESP8266, ESP32)

---

## Hardware (suggested)

- Microcontroller: ESP32 or ESP8266 recommended for built-in Wi‑Fi. Arduino UNO can be used with a Wi‑Fi module.
- Servos: 4–6 hobby servos (SG90 / MG90S / MG995 depending on torque needed)
- Power supply: Separate 5V (or appropriate) supply capable of servicing all servos (do NOT power servos from microcontroller 5V regulator)
- Level shifting / common ground between microcontroller and servo power
- Optional: limit switches, potentiometers for joint feedback, IMU (e.g., MPU6050)

---

## Typical wiring / pinout (example)

- Vcc (servo power) -> External 5V supply (capable of servo current)
- GND -> Common ground between microcontroller and servo power supply
- Servo 1 (base) signal -> GPIO D1 (example)
- Servo 2 (shoulder) signal -> GPIO D2
- Servo 3 (elbow) signal -> GPIO D3
- Servo 4 (wrist) signal -> GPIO D4
- Servo 5 (gripper) signal -> GPIO D5
- Limit switch -> any digital input with pullup
- IMU (I2C) -> SDA / SCL

Adjust pins to match the specific board and the pin definitions in the source files.

---

## Software requirements

- Arduino IDE (latest) or PlatformIO
- If using ESP modules:
  - ESP8266 or ESP32 board packages installed in Arduino IDE
  - or use PlatformIO with an appropriate board environment
- Libraries commonly used (examples):
  - Servo.h
  - WiFi.h / ESP8266WiFi.h
  - PubSubClient (for MQTT)
  - ArduinoJson (optional for JSON payloads)
  - Wire (for I2C sensors)

Install required libraries through the Arduino Library Manager or PlatformIO's lib_deps.

---

## Installation & build

Arduino IDE:
1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/yasinarafathemon/IoT_BASED_ROBOTIC_ARM-main.git
2. Open the appropriate sketch from the repository (e.g., `examples/robotic_arm.ino`) in Arduino IDE.
3. Select your board (ESP32/ESP8266/Arduino) and correct COM port.
4. Install any missing libraries via Sketch → Include Library → Manage Libraries...
5. Edit the configuration section (network, pins, MQTT) in the sketch.
6. Upload.

PlatformIO:
1. Open the repository in VS Code with PlatformIO extension.
2. Inspect `platformio.ini` (or create one) to set the board environment.
3. Add required lib_deps if not present.
4. Configure settings in `src/config.h` or equivalent configuration file.
5. Build and upload using the PlatformIO toolbar.

---

## Configuration

Look for a configuration file or constants at the top of the main sketch/source file. Typical settings include:

- Wi‑Fi
  - ssid: "your-ssid"
  - password: "your-password"
- MQTT (optional)
  - broker: "mqtt.example.com"
  - port: 1883
  - topic: "roboticarm/commands"
  - clientId: "robotic-arm-01"
- Pin mapping
  - BASE_SERVO_PIN, SHOULDER_SERVO_PIN, etc.
- Serial baud (e.g., 115200)
- Calibration angles / servo limits

Make sure to never commit sensitive credentials to a public repo. Use configuration placeholders or environment variables where possible.

---

## Usage

- Upload the firmware to your microcontroller.
- Power the servos from the external supply and ensure common ground.
- Connect microcontroller to local Wi‑Fi network (check Serial monitor for status).
- Send commands via:
  - MQTT topic payloads (JSON or simple commands)
  - HTTP endpoints if implemented (GET/POST)
  - Serial commands for local control
- Use provided example client scripts or a dashboard (e.g., Node-RED, MQTT.fx, custom web app)

Example MQTT command (JSON):
{ "joint": "base", "angle": 90 }

## Code structure (recommended / typical)

This repository may contain:

- src/ or firmware/
  - main sketch(s) / .ino or .cpp files
  - config.h (pin and network settings)
  - servo_control.cpp / servo_control.h
  - network.cpp / network.h
  - mqtt_handler.cpp / mqtt_handler.h
- hardware/
  - wiring diagrams, schematics, PCB files
- docs/
  - manuals, calibration guides
- examples/
  - simple control examples and test scripts

Adjust to the actual layout found in this repo. If the repo differs, open the top-level folders and update the file paths accordingly.

---

## Troubleshooting

- Servos twitch or behave erratically:
  - Ensure servo power supply can provide sufficient current.
  - Add decoupling capacitors and ensure common ground.
- Microcontroller resets when servos move:
  - Use separate power supply for servos. Do not draw servo power from the microcontroller alone.
- Wi‑Fi doesn't connect:
  - Check SSID/password and Wi‑Fi region.
  - Check Serial monitor logs for errors.
- MQTT connection fails:
  - Verify broker address/port and credentials.
  - Try connecting with an MQTT client (MQTT.fx, mosquitto_sub) to confirm broker readiness.
