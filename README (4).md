## Project Overview

The **IoT BASED ROBOTIC ARM** enables remote control and automation of a robotic arm using IoT protocols. By integrating microcontrollers and sensors, the system receives commands over the internet and translates them into precise movements. The project is ideal for those looking to learn about embedded systems, robotics, and IoT integration.

## Features

- **Remote Control:** Operate the robotic arm from anywhere via IoT connectivity.
- **Sensor Integration:** Feedback from sensors for precise movement and positioning.
- **Modular Design:** Easily extendable to add more degrees of freedom or sensors.
- **Open Source:** Freely available for modification and redistribution.

## Hardware Requirements

- Microcontroller (e.g., Arduino, ESP8266/ESP32, STM32)
- Servo motors for arm joints
- WiFi Module (if not integrated)
- Power supply for motors and microcontroller
- Sensors (optional: position, force, etc.)
- Basic electronic components (wires, breadboard, resistors, etc.)

## Software Requirements

- C++ and C compiler (e.g., Arduino IDE, PlatformIO, GCC)
- IoT platform or messaging service (e.g., MQTT broker, Blynk, ThingSpeak, etc.)
- Serial Monitor for debugging

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yasinarafathemon/IoT_BASED_ROBOTIC_ARM-main.git
   cd IoT_BASED_ROBOTIC_ARM-main
   ```

2. **Configure the microcontroller:**
   - Connect the hardware as per your design.
   - Edit configuration files for WiFi credentials and IoT platform settings.

3. **Upload the code:**
   - Use your preferred IDE to compile and upload the source code to your microcontroller.

## Usage

- Power on the robotic arm system.
- Ensure the microcontroller is connected to WiFi.
- Send commands via the configured IoT platform/app.
- Monitor feedback from sensors (if enabled).
